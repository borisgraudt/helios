## Abstract

This report presents ASL&AI, a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system that achieves 97.2% accuracy on alphabet sign classification. The system combines computer vision techniques (MediaPipe) with deep learning (TensorFlow/Keras) to provide privacy-preserving, edge-deployable gesture recognition. Our approach uses position-invariant preprocessing of hand landmarks, enabling robust recognition across different hand orientations and camera positions. The system processes gestures in real-time with <5ms inference latency, making it suitable for practical applications. We evaluate the system on a dataset of 10,508 samples across 26 ASL alphabet classes, demonstrating high accuracy and low computational overhead. The modular architecture supports future enhancements including a fairness audit across skin tones and lighting conditions, and sentence-level translation. This work contributes to accessibility technology by providing an open-source, locally-processed solution for ASL-to-text translation.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Approximately 70 million people worldwide use sign language as their primary means of communication. However, communication barriers persist between sign language users and non-signers, limiting access to education, employment, and social services. Automated sign language recognition systems can bridge this gap by providing real-time translation capabilities.

Traditional solutions face significant limitations:
- **Sensor-based systems** require specialized hardware (gloves with sensors), making them impractical for everyday use
- **Classical computer vision approaches** lack sufficient accuracy for reliable translation
- **Cloud-based AI systems** raise privacy concerns and introduce latency
- **Resource-intensive models** cannot run on standard hardware in real-time

### 1.2 Problem Statement

We aim to develop a real-time ASL recognition system that:
1. Achieves high accuracy (>95%) on ASL alphabet recognition
2. Processes gestures in real-time (<10ms latency)
3. Operates entirely locally without cloud dependencies
4. Runs on standard hardware without specialized sensors
5. Provides a foundation for future enhancements (sentence-level translation, fairness audit)

### 1.3 Contributions

This work makes the following contributions:
1. **Position-invariant preprocessing pipeline** that normalizes hand landmarks for robust recognition
2. **Edge-optimized neural architecture** achieving 97.2% accuracy with <5MB model size
3. **Real-time inference system** with <5ms latency on CPU
4. **Open-source implementation** with production-ready code architecture
5. **Privacy-preserving design** with complete local processing

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Sign Language Recognition Approaches

Sign language recognition has been approached through multiple paradigms:

**Sensor-based methods** use accelerometers, gyroscopes, and flex sensors embedded in gloves [1]. While accurate, these systems require specialized hardware and are impractical for everyday use.

**Vision-based methods** can be categorized as:
- **Traditional computer vision**: Template matching, HMMs, and hand-crafted features [2]
- **Deep learning approaches**: CNNs for image-based recognition [3], RNNs/LSTMs for temporal sequences [4]
- **Hybrid approaches**: Combining multiple modalities [5]

### 2.2 Hand Landmark Detection

MediaPipe Hands [6] provides real-time hand tracking with 21 3D landmarks. It offers a good balance between accuracy and speed, making it suitable for real-time applications. Our work builds upon MediaPipe for landmark extraction, focusing on robust preprocessing and classification.

### 2.3 Deep Learning for Gesture Recognition

Recent work has shown that fully connected networks can achieve high accuracy on hand gesture recognition when provided with well-preprocessed landmark features [7]. Our architecture follows this approach but emphasizes position-invariance through preprocessing rather than relying solely on model capacity.

### 2.4 Comparison with Our Approach

Unlike many existing systems that require:
- Cloud connectivity for inference
- High-end GPUs for real-time performance
- Specialized hardware (sensors, high-resolution cameras)

Our system achieves high accuracy with:
- Complete local processing
- CPU-only inference
- Standard webcam input
- Position-invariant preprocessing for robustness

```

### 3.2 Hand Detection and Landmark Extraction

We use MediaPipe Hands to detect and track hands in real-time. MediaPipe provides 21 3D landmarks per hand:

- **Wrist** (landmark 0): Reference point for normalization
- **Thumb** (landmarks 1-4): 4 points
- **Index finger** (landmarks 5-8): 4 points
- **Middle finger** (landmarks 9-12): 4 points
- **Ring finger** (landmarks 13-16): 4 points
- **Pinky** (landmarks 17-20): 4 points

Each landmark provides $(x, y, z)$ coordinates relative to the image frame.

### 3.3 Position-Invariant Preprocessing

A key innovation of our approach is position-invariant normalization, which makes the system robust to:
- Different hand positions in the camera frame
- Varying distances from the camera
- Hand rotations and orientations

#### 3.3.1 Normalization Algorithm

Given a set of landmarks $L = \{l_0, l_1, ..., l_{20}\}$ where each $l_i = (x_i, y_i, z_i)$:

1. **Centering**: Translate all landmarks relative to the wrist (landmark 0):
   $$
   l'_i = l_i - l_0 \quad \forall i \in [0, 20]
   $$

2. **Scaling**: Normalize to unit maximum distance:
   $$
   d_{max} = \max_{i} ||l'_i||_2
   $$
   $$
   l''_i = \frac{l'_i}{d_{max}} \quad \text{if } d_{max} > 0
   $$

3. **Feature Vector**: Flatten to 63-dimensional vector:
   $$
   \mathbf{f} = [l''_0, l''_1, ..., l''_{20}] \in \mathbb{R}^{63}
   $$

This normalization ensures that:
- The wrist is always at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$
- The maximum distance from the wrist is 1.0
- Gestures are invariant to translation and scale

#### 3.3.2 Standardization

For training, we apply StandardScaler from scikit-learn:
$$
\mathbf{f}_{scaled} = \frac{\mathbf{f} - \boldsymbol{\mu}}{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}
$$
where $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ are the mean and standard deviation computed on the training set.

### 3.4 Neural Network Architecture

We use a fully connected neural network (FCNN) optimized for edge deployment:

**Input Layer:**
- 63 features (21 landmarks × 3 coordinates)

**Hidden Layers:**
- **Layer 1**: 256 neurons, ReLU activation, Batch Normalization, Dropout (0.3)
- **Layer 2**: 128 neurons, ReLU activation, Batch Normalization, Dropout (0.2)
- **Layer 3**: 64 neurons, ReLU activation, Batch Normalization, Dropout (0.1)

**Output Layer:**
- 26 neurons (one per ASL letter A-Z), Softmax activation

**Mathematical Formulation:**

For a layer with input $\mathbf{x}$, weights $\mathbf{W}$, bias $\mathbf{b}$:
$$
\mathbf{h} = \text{ReLU}(\text{BN}(\mathbf{W}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}))
$$
$$
\mathbf{y} = \text{Dropout}(\mathbf{h}, p)
$$

where:
- $\text{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z)$
- $\text{BN}$ is Batch Normalization
- $\text{Dropout}$ randomly sets a fraction $p$ of activations to zero during training

**Total Parameters:** ~95,000 (model size <5MB)

### 3.5 Training Procedure

**Optimizer:** Adam with learning rate 0.001

**Loss Function:** Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
$$
\mathcal{L} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \log P(y_i | \mathbf{x}_i)
$$

**Regularization:**
- Dropout: 0.3 → 0.2 → 0.1 (decreasing through layers)
- Batch Normalization: Applied after each dense layer
- Early Stopping: Patience of 10 epochs
- Learning Rate Reduction: Factor 0.5, patience 5 epochs

**Training Configuration:**
- Batch size: 64
- Maximum epochs: 50
- Validation split: 20%
- Data shuffling: Enabled

### 3.6 Real-Time Inference

For real-time prediction, we implement:

1. **Prediction Smoothing**: Maintain a history of the last 5 predictions and use majority voting to reduce flickering
2. **Confidence Thresholding**: Only display predictions with confidence > 0.5
3. **Model Warm-up**: Pre-load model and run dummy inference to initialize TensorFlow graph
